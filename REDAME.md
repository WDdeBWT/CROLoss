# CROLoss

Model code for paper *CROLoss: Towards a Customizable Loss for Retrieval Models in Recommender Systems*. You can find the paper in <https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02971>.

## Core code

The core_code.py file provides a simple code template to show how to deploy CROLoss in your retrieval model (to replace the softmax cross-entropy loss). We hope this can help you better understand our method.
